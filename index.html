    <h1>Ellens school diary</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>This week I've learned the basics of coding a website! We went through some basics of html and git.
    <br>
    Html does'nt seem that difficult except that there are alot of different tags to learn.
    <br>
    Still, I assume that there is alot more to come since my website looks like this right now
    <br>
    This week I've learned about heading and text tags to create simple headings and paragraphs
    <br>
    I've also learned how to make text <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> etc.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>If you are seeing this, i've also learned how to upload any changes to github.</p>
